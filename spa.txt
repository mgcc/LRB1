SPA

Refreshing doesn't happen every time to go to another page

Upon visiting a website, most of the site's resources are already loaded.

The user is clicking around your site, interacting with it. Fetching new data, sending data to the server.  In traditional websites, sending/getting data to/from a server would mean a page reload every time.

The client does most of the heavy lifting from them. If it needs to communicate some data to/from the server, it will, but it won't reload the page.



Pros
 - fluid, native desktop-like experience
 - saves on bandwidth since it doesn't have to reload entire pages

Cons
 - harder to develop
 - the client is doing most of the work
 - initial download of resources can be heavy for the client
